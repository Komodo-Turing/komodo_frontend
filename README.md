One of the most effective ways of preventing overuse is to make sure someone stays with you while you use a substance. This, however, is not always an option for everybody. This Rails App ([FE deployed endpoint](https://komodo-frontend.herokuapp.com)) ([BE deployed endpoint])(https://komodo-backend.herokuapp.com))was created to mitigate this issue. It lets a client create emergency contacts and start a timer when they are about to use a substance. If the timer is not stopped before it runs out, it will text their contacts with the client's address, map and other information pre-created by the client.    

#### What can I do on Komodo?
  - Sign up and sign in using Google OAuth 2.0
  - Create emergency contacts with their name and phone number
  - Create timers with information such as:
    - Duration in minutes (the only required information)
    - Substance
    - Dosage
    - Entry Instructions and other notes
  - Start a timer
  - Cancel the timer before it goes off
